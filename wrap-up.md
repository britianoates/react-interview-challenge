My initial commit contained the transactions table and some of the server side rendering.  Ideally I would have separated those apart. I was creating the server side validators and knew I would need transactions to perform some of them. Putting a placeholder seemed weird than doing it for real. I did them together, but if the enhancements could possibly be merged separately I would ensure no partial features were in place and add transactions to the validators separately.
